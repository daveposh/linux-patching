# Profile: Update only nginx package
# This profile updates only nginx, skipping all other packages

# Update type (security or all)
# For a specific package like nginx, "all" is typically better to ensure
# you get any updates (not just security)
UPDATE_TYPE="all"

# Allow reboot-required packages
# Set to true if you want to update nginx even if it requires reboot
# Set to false if you want to skip nginx if it requires reboot
ALLOW_REBOOT_PACKAGES=false

# Only allow nginx package updates
# This overrides the default behavior and limits updates to nginx only
ALLOW_PACKAGES=(
    "nginx"
)

# Note: If nginx requires reboot and ALLOW_REBOOT_PACKAGES=false,
#       nginx will still be skipped. Set ALLOW_REBOOT_PACKAGES=true
#       if you want to update nginx regardless of reboot requirement.
